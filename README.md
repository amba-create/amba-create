# Hello, I'm Amba 

I'm a final-year Mathematics and Actuarial Science student at the University of Leicester with a strong interest in data analytics, statistical modelling, and quantitative finance.

## About Me

Within my degree, I've completed six IFoA actuarial exams (CM1, CM2, CS1, CS2, CB1, CB2) and have professional experience from a placement at Swiss Re in Behavioural Science. My work combines rigorous statistical methodology with practical problem-solving, and I'm currently exploring opportunities in data analytics and quantitative roles.

## Technical Skills

- **Languages:** R, Python, SQL
- **Statistical Methods:** Monte Carlo simulation, GLMs, time series analysis, stochastic processes
- **Tools:** tidyverse, ggplot2, Excel
- **Areas:** Risk modelling, financial engineering, climate risk analysis

## Featured Projects using R
- **Time Series Analysis** - Comparing maximum and minimum temperature trends using statistical forecasting methods and trend decomposition
- **Stock Price Modelling** — Financial engineering application using Geometric Brownian Motion for equity price analysis
- **Retail Transaction Analysis** — Data analytics project exploring purchasing patterns and customer segmentation

## Projects using Python
- **Portfolio Optimisation** – Constructing optimal investment portfolios using Modern Portfolio Theory and stress-testing with Monte Carlo simulation to quantify risk

  
## Currently Working On
**Flood Protection Gap Analysis** — Actuarial research comparing climate risk exposure in Bangladesh and Japan using Monte Carlo simulation (10,000 iterations) and tail risk analysis
